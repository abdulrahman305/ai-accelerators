description: 'This use case aims to develop a machine learning model that utilizes
  historical data, including customer and transactional information, to identify alerts
  that resulted in the generation of a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).

  The model will assign a suspicious activity score to future alerts, improving the
  effectiveness and efficiency of an AML compliance program by prioritizing alerts
  based on their ranking order according to the score.'

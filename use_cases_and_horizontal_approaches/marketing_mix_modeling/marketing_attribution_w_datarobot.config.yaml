file_name: marketing_attribution_w_datarobot.ipynb
description: |-
  Marketing attribution can be defined as the process of assigning credit to certain marketing activities (e.g., spending) as they contribute towards a desired goal (e.g., increases in revenue). Understanding how much these marketing activities contribute enables stakeholders to make better budget allocation decisions. However, in todayâ€™s world, marketing teams have many avenues to spend their marketing dollars, and it can be a daunting task to figure out which avenues are playing the largest role towards optimizing the key performance indicator (KPI) of interest. Model-based approaches can help sift through all this information in a rigorous and efficient way, leading to faster decision-making.

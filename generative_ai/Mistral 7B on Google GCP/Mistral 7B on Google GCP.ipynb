   "source": "Mistral 7B on Google GCP and DataRobot\n======================================\n\nThere are a wide variety of open source models. For example, there has been a lot of interest in LLama and variations such as Alpaca or Vicuna, Falcon, Mistral etc. Hosting these is a challenge as they require GPUs which are expensive so often customers want to compare cloud providers to find the best hosting option to meet their own needs. In this example we will work with Google Cloud Platform.\n\nIn addition, customers may want to integrate with the same cloud provider that hosts their VPC. That way they can ensure proper authentication and access only from within their VPC. While this authenticator uses authentication over the public internet, it should then be possible for the user to extend to leverage Google's cloud infrastructure to adjust to suit their cloud architectural needs, including provisioning scale out policies.\n\nFinally, by leveraging Vertex AI in a managed format, it can integrate into the customer's existing infrastructure level monitoring needs. For example, instances can be labelled to correspond to the customer's billing attribution polices, or logs and analytics can be set up to be written into their Big Query for monitoring and analytics.

GCP Projects\n\nEverything in GCP is owned by a project, which tracks billing, authentication, access control, etc. Whenever you interact in either the GUI or using the API clients you will need to be in a project context. You can create a project at [https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate] or under IAM & Admin > Create a Project.\n\n## 2. Authentication and Service Accounts\n\nGCP does *not* provide \"API Keys\". Instead it provides auto-expiring dynamic tokens after authorizing. Each separate request you make to Google will have a different token in the headers. After a period of time you will have to reauthorize. If you use Collab, Workbench, or Cloud Shell, Google will hande the authentication in the background for you after authorization. \n\nIn order for our envionsed workflow to work, we will need a service account, an account which will run the cloud function workflow on our behalf (in this situation our account will be the principal). Using a service account, as opposed to a user account, means that multiple people can use our flow. In addition, there are certain things within GCP that can only be done by service accounts.\n\nThis service account will need access to the following roles:\n\n* Vertex AI User\n\nAs well as the following permissions on our Cloud Stoage bucket to be able to write to it.\n* Storage Legacy Bucket Owner\n* Storage Legacy Object Owner\n\nFor more information about service accounts look here: [https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create].\n\n## 3. Regions\n\nWe will use us-central1 (Iowa) for everything. This is because it is one of the two regions that have extensive GPU capacity (along with eu-west4 (Netherlands). The instance types available within Vertex AI vary by region.\n\n\n## 4. Cloud Storage Bucket\n\nLastly, before getting started we will need a bucket to hold stuff as we work in GCP. Google in general requires a bucket to be able to execute many of the tasks since they require storing some information somewhere, and a bucket is where that happens\n\nOnce you have decided on a project, location, bucket and storage account fill in the values below:\n                                                                                                                            ",

   "source": "First time setup \n================\n\nThe following sections consist of the tasks you should do once the first time to setup the enviornment and then you will need to restart the kernel. We will do the following steps:\n\n1. Install the lastest version google cloud ai platform SDK.\n\nThis is the latest version that interacts with VertexAI\n\n2. Set up authentication by using application default credenitals created in a different environment\n\nThe typical authoriztion flow is command line command --> web browser authorization --> enter authorization information. In our notebooks that is tricky as we would need to be able to enter the authorization into the output shell. We also typically would generate both cli credentials via `gcloud init` or `gcloud auth login` which would create credentials in a local credentials db as well as create application default credentials via `gcloud auth application-default login` to generate the credentials usable via the python library. \n\nInstead the flow will be: generate credentials on your local machine --> base64 encode --> update the environment variables to point to the uploaded credentials. These will be stored [https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/dr-notebooks/code-nb/dr-env-nb.html#environment-variables encrypted by DataRobot] but keep in mind that base64 encoding itself isn't encryption and treat these base64 encoded credentials like you would treat any password.\n\n1. Create local credentials\n\nInstall the google sdk in your local enivornment. Then run `gcloud init` and make sure to set your default project accordingly. Then you can run `gcloud auth application-default login`\n\nTo install the google command line sdk in your local environment you can run:\n\n```\ncurl -O https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/downloads/google-cloud-cli-445.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz\ntar -xf \"google-cloud-cli-445.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz\"\n./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh --usage-reporting=false --quiet\n```\n\nYou should see output like:\n```\nCredentials saved to file: [/Users/mark/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json]\n\nThese credentials will be used by any library that requests Application Default Credentials (ADC).\n\nQuota project \"octo-385122\" was added to ADC which can be used by Google client libraries for billing and quota. Note that some services may still bill the project owning the resource.\n```\n\n2. Base64 credentials\n\nThe recommended version is to base64 encode as an environment variable. This is because any credentials uploaded to file storage is immediately shared when sharing the notebook. This can leverage DataRobot's built in credential storage.\n\n```\nbase64 -i /Users/mark/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json\n```\n\nto generate the string. You can then copy and paste this as the environment variable: `GOOGLE_ENCODED_CREDENTIAL`\n\n3. Create credentials object\n\nIf you base64 encoded you can then create a credentials object in your local notebook environment via running the following:\n\n```\nimport base64\nimport os\nimport google.oauth2.credential\n\nadc_decoded = base64.b64decode(os.getenv(\"GOOGLE_ENCODED_CREDENTIAL\"))\ncredentials = google.oauth2.credentials.Credentials.from_authorized_user_info(json.loads(adc_decoded))\n```\n\n\nNow we can pass the credentials into `aiplatfrom.init` to set the global configuration which will be used in future calls to Vertex AI\n\n```\nfrom google.cloud import aiplatform\naiplatform.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=REGION, staging_bucket=STAGING_BUCKET, credentials=credentials)\n```\n\nThe following two cells will install the required packages and initialize the environment while the third cell will print out the current settings for user verification\n",

In Vertex AI the resources are set on the endpoint, not the model.\n\nModel Serving with pytorch and vLLM\n=======================\n\nVertex AI models can work with any docker container that provides an http endpoint for Vertex to pass along the generation request to. In this case the Vertex Endpoint will provide traffic sharing and versioning by handling the routing among multiple posssible backend models or instances while the docker container running the model will handle the actual request handling and prociessing.\n\nHence the need for both a model running framework (i.e. the actual loading of the model weights and computation) as well as a model serving framework (i.e. the web server and request processing). In this example we will use pytorch and VLLM.\n\nModel running frameworks\n========================\n\nModel running frameworks provide a variety of options that try to acheive different goals\n\n* pytorch\n* HuggingFace Transformers\n* HuggingFace Accelerate\n* DeepSpeed Inference\n* Nvidia TensorRT-LLM\n* FasterTransformer\n\nModel Serving Frameworks\n========================\n\nModel serving frameworks handle both request level management (e.g. batching and allocating requests among different works) as well as tasks like real time streaming of generation. While outside the scope of this example, they are also able to do things such as efficient request level switching between different fine-tuned variants of a model using techniques like LoRA, watermarking requests, or integration into telemetry infrastructure like Prometheus. While some frameworks like Triton are designed to work with a variety of different model running frameworks, others are tightly coupled to a particular framework.\n\nOpen source options include:\n* FastAPI\n* DJL-Serving [https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl-serving], Apache 2.0 license\n* NVIDIA Triton [https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server], BSD-3 license\n* vLLM [https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm], Apache 2.0 license\n* HunggingFace Text Generation Inference (TGI) [https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference], HFOILv1.0 license. \n\nPytorch and vLLM on GCP\n=======================\n\nWe will use pytorch and vLLM for this example. vLLM is designed to provide efficient serving of multiple models in production settings so this should provide a good starting point for future configuration and testing what an actual production deployment might look like. It provides an OpenAI api compatible server with streaming and support for many popular models since it leverages HF Transformers, although because it requires perfomance tweaks not all models are supported out of the box [https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html]. A description of the various arguments is here [https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/engine_args.html].\n\nThe first cell defiens the various constants to use. The model id and instance information is easily adjustable to try out different options. We leverage the built in docker container from vertex, it is possible to instead build and upload an image to GCP for your own needs.\n\nThe next cell defines the deployment function. It creates the endpoint, uploads the docker container to create the model and then deploys the model onto the endpoint. The last cell calls it with the parameters from the first cell.

Here's how it works:\n1. **Bootstrap samples**: Each tree in the Random Forest is built on a different bootstrap sample of the training data, drawn with replacement. This means that each tree will see a subset of the original training data, with some instances possibly being included multiple times.\n2. **Reducing variance**: By training each tree on slightly different data, Bagging helps to decrease the variance of the Random Forest. This is important because trees are prone to overfitting on the training data. When each tree is exposed to different instances in the training set, it will learn slightly different decision surfaces, and the errors will average out, resulting in better generalization performance.\n3. **Diversity**: Bagging also enhances the diversity of the trees in the\n"

Here's how it can boost Random Forest:\n1. Diversity: Bagging reduces overfitting by creating several Decision Trees and combining their outputs to increase the diversity of the model. By training trees on different samples of the data, Bagging helps ensure that the trees learn different aspects of the data, which in turn helps to reduce the correlation among the trees in the Random Forest.\n2. Reducing variance: Bagging reduces the variance of the model by averaging the predictions of individual Decision Trees. Since each tree is trained on a different bootstrap sample, the errors made by one tree may be different from the errors made by another tree.

Because both the scopes, what services the token is valid for, and the permissions are able to be narrowly defined, these tokens are generally far less powerful than the source credentials.\n\nSeparately, this makes it easier to manage access across multiple accounts. As long as a user has access to the service account, they have access to the resources to make a prediction without worrying about needing to grant the appropriate permissions for each indiviudal resource, it also means that a user can be removed easily without breaking things (e.g. if the creator leaves the organization).\n\nThis code makes a subprocess call to the `drum` custom model utility and checks that it completed successful.

description: This accelerator walks through all of the new DataRobot generative AI capabilities and serves
  as a template for code-first users. It showcases how to create and use playgrounds, connect vector databases
  and LLMs, and how to query and compare them. It uses the official DataRobot documentation as an example.
  Furthermore, it combines DataRobot's well-known custom model capablities to allow users to bring their
  own LLMs and vector databases. It shows how to link, use, and deploy them together with the ones offered
  by DataRobot.

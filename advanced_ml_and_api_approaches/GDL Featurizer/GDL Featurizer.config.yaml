description: Tabular data is one of the most common ways data is represented in machine learning. However,
  it is not the only structure that can be used. Many real-world problems involve relationships between
  entities that can be better captured using graph structures. Graph data represents entities as nodes
  and relationships as edges, making it a powerful tool for capturing relational dependencies. This accelerator
  shows how one can enrich the feature space with graph-based embeddings automatically through use of
  DataRobotâ€™s custom transformer functionality.

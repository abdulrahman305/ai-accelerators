description: "Eureqa is a symbolic regression algorithm that searches the space of mathematical expressions\
  \ to find the best fit for a given dataset, while minimizing both error and complexity.\nEureqa came\
  \ out of Cornell's AI Lab in 2009, developed into a company called Nutonian, and then was acquired by\
  \ DataRobot in 2017.\nEureqa now lives as a blueprint within DataRobot."

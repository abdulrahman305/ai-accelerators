title: Dimensionality reduction in DataRobot with t-SNE
file_name: Dimensionality reduction in DataRobot with t-SNE.ipynb
description: |-
  t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a powerful technique for dimensionality reduction that can effectively visualize high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space. Dimensionality reduction can improve machine learning results by reducing computational complexity of the algorithms, preventing overfitting, and focusing on the most relevant features in the dataset.
